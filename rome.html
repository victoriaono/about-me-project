Anywhere you might set foot in Rome, you would probably come across an ancient feature. I have never been to Rome, but it is high on my list of cities that I want to visit. Ever since learning about the Roman Empire in global history last year, I have been fascinated by the city.</p>

<!-- Description of Roman history -->
<div class="pt2">
	<p><span class="first_letter">R</span>ome dates all the way back to 9th century, when it was ruled by the neighbor kings. The Roman Empire was established in 27 BC with the first emperor Augustus. From this year for a few hundred years the empire experienced Pax Romana, where Rome prospered as the most peaceful. Aqueducts and long roads were built, making the empire efficient for its size. The Colosseum served as a place for entertainment. Although the empire fell in 476 AD, the papal power remained in this place, and the current city retains its holy and historical spirit. </p>

	<p><span class="first_letter">I</span>f I can go to Rome one day, I would love to visit some of these historical places. The most famous one is the Colosseum. Built in 70 AD, it is the largest amphitheatre that was ever built. I love the semi-broken building, and just by looking at the photos I can sense the history compacted in the place. Another spot I would love to visit is the Pantheon. It resembles the Greek architecture of the columns as well as the Roman architecture of the dome. Lastly, the Trevi Fountain looks gorgeous, and I would want to throw a coin in the iconic way.</p>

	Vatican City is located within Rome, and I would love to visit the Sistine Chapel with the ceiling painted by Michelangelo, and St. Peter's Basilica with the gorgeous architecture. Rome is filled with centuries of historical architecture, and my dream is to explore the city while remembering what I learned in school.</p>

I have always wanted to visit the Mediterranean Sea because of its beautiful water and the islands above it. On top of that, I love beaches. Sicily is an island in southern Italy that is surrounded by Mediterranean Sea. Taking a trip down to the shore from Rome would be a great experience.</p>
