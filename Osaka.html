	<p> <!-- Link to Osaka city homepage --> <a href="http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/" target="_blank"><span class="first_letter">O</span>saka</a> (<span lang="ja">大阪</span>) is the second biggest city in Japan, first being the capital, Tokyo.<br>It is my favorite city mainly because it is my <b>hometown</b>. In my opinion, it is very similar to <!-- Link to my NYC page --><a href="NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>. There are blocks of parallel streets and avenues filled with many buildings.<br>

	The stores that surround the city allow people to shop endlessly and always obtain <i>food</i>. There are many large department stores and malls as well, and I can shop all day trying new stores because there are countless options.</p>

	<p><img src="images/takoyaki.jpg" alt="takoyaki" height="35%" width="35%" class="float_right"><span class="first_letter">T</span>he food in the city is delicious and unique, making the city well known for its cuisine. The most iconic street food in Osaka is called <b>takoyaki</b> (<span lang="ja">たこ焼き</span>), a flour-based ball battered and cooked in a specialpan.<br>It is filled with a small piece of octopus ("tako") and can be eaten alone or topped with sauce, mayonnaise, minced green onion and katsuobushi (dried bonito shavings). This ranks high on my list of favorite food, and the original taste can be acquired <i>only</i> in Osaka.</p>
	<p class="first_line" style="clear:right;padding-top:15px;"><img src="images/okonomiyaki.jpg" alt="okonomiyaki" height="25%" width="25%" class="float_left">Another famous food is <b>okonomiyaki</b> (<span lang="ja">お好み焼き</span>), a savory pancake containing various ingredients, such as cabbage, sliced pork, konnyaku (konjac), and nagaimo (type of mountain yam). In Japanese, "okonomi" means "as you like," so there are many types of okonomiyaki. Its toppings are similar to those of takoyaki.</p>

Although it has been reconstructed a few times, the castle and its surroundings remain as a historic part of the city.

<!-- More about Osaka such as people, weather and events -->
<div class="pt4">
	<p><span class="first_letter">P</span>eople in Osaka are quite friendly. They are not as judgmental as those in other areas of Japan. The population is large, which is what I prefer to live my everyday life.</p>
	<p class="first_line">The climate in Osaka is ideal in terms of temperature, although it is humid. It does not snow during the winter, which may be a detriment, but it does not get as cold as it does in New York. This type of weather is my favorite because I prefer warmer weather and longer summers.</p>
	<p class="first_line">Along with an abundance of firework shows, there are many Japanese festivals in the city occurring mostly in the summer. One of the three most famous festivals in Japan is held in the heart of the city, called <!-- Link to page about the festival --><a href="https://www.osaka-info.jp/en/events/festivals_events/post_20.html" target="_blank"><b>Tenjin-matsuri</b> (<span lang="ja">天神祭</span>)</a>.<br>There are numerous stands that sell street food, including takoyaki and castella (a Japanese sponge cake). There are also games in the festivals such as kingyo-sukui (<span lang="ja">金魚すくい</span>; goldfish scooping). These games and food are fun moments that I get to experience when I go to Osaka.</p>
