<!-- Brief description about NYC -->
<a id="overview"><div class="pt1"></a>
	<p><span class="first_letter">N</span>ew York City can be considered one of the most popular cities in the world. About 50 million tourists visit New York every year from all over the world. Many famous people live here as well, including Tina Fey, Taylor Swift, and Bille Nye the Science Guy. <br>There are five boroughs in NYC: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. I like this city because I have lived here for some time now, and the ambiance has grown on me. I can only live in big cities; the constant noise and the busy streets comfort me.</p>

It is my favorite borough not only because I live in it, but because of how busy the streets are. Although I despise the frequent sirens that ring in my ears and the tourists taking up much of the space on the sidewalk, I like being in the crowd and being surrounded by skyscrapers. I love walking down Fifth Avenue especially. There is a myriad of aesthetic stores that are of worth taking pictures. I also love Soho with the cobblestoned streets. And of course, I love shopping.</p>

It is a little quieter uptown, and the <!-- Link to website of the Grange --><a href="https://www.nps.gov/hagr/index.htm" target="_blank">Hamilton Grange</a> is located there. As a big fan of the musical <i>Hamilton</i>, visiting the relocated home of the Founding Father Alexander Hamilton is an exciting experience.</p>

<!-- Introducing some sightseeing spots -->
<div class="pt3">
	<p><span class="first_letter">N</span>ew York attracts millions of tourists for its sightseeing spots. My personal favorites are Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty, and Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Living a walking distance from the Rockefeller Center is great because there are cute cafes and stores nearby, and in the winter, they open their iconic ice skating rink with a huge Christmas tree. Statue of Liberty has a special place in my heart because I visited there when I was 2 years old and still living in Japan. Brooklyn Botanical Garden is also my favorite because of the pretty trees and flowers and the section dedicated to Japanese nature.</p>

	Although winter in New York is extremely cold and seems to last forever every time, tourists are abundant in this season. Over a million people visit Times Square for the balldrop at the end of every year regardless of the weather. Since I live in the area, I usually stop by to count down to the new year.</p>

<!-- Description of Broadway shows -->
<div class="pt4">
	<p><span class="first_letter">N</span>ew York City can be best known for Broadway shows. I am grateful that I live near a bunch of Broadway theatres because I get to see the best musicals with beautiful sets. There are so many shows to see with brilliant casts, and I see one at least once or twice a year. I have seen <i>West Side Story</i>, <i>Annie</i>, <i>Mamma Mia</i>, and <i>Les Miserables</i>, to name a few. Sadly, I have not seen <!-- Link to Hamilton Broadway site --><a href="http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com" target="_blank"><i>Hamilton</i></a>; living five blocks away from the theatre does not increase my chance of seeing the show. &#9785;</p>
