	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Life in Japan</h3>
	<p><span class="first_letter">I</span> was born in a concrete jungle in <!-- Link to my Osaka page --><a href="Osaka.html">Osaka</a>, Japan. As an only child, my mother brought me up teaching me a variety of lessons.	Ever since I was little, I immersed myself in arts: ballet from age 3 and piano from age 5. Ballet was, and is, my life. I went to lessons 6 times a week, performed in two recitals every year, and danced two different variations. Piano was more of a <!-- Link to my hobbies page --><a href="hobbies.html">hobby</a> to me, but I learned to play a waltz by Chopin, which became my ultimate favorite and a special piece of my life. I would also play duets with my mom, which remains one of my best memories. <br>My mom introduced me to western music, especially songs from the '80s and musicals. I would sing them in car rides not knowing the meanings of the lyrics. At 7 years old, I was obsessed with <i>West Side Story</i>.</p>

	</div>
	<p class="first_line">While my mother taught me arts, my father read to me and taught me academics, especially math. I grew up loving math and science. We would all go to a science museum with a planetarium, or take a road trip to stargaze and name the stars or to observe a solar eclipse. By second grade, I was able to solve middle school level math and calculate large numbers in my head quickly. In 4th grade, I placed first in a countrywide academic test in Japan.</p>

	<p class="first_line">In 2009, my dream then came true. I received a puppy for my birthday present, and we named her <b>Marie Antoinette</b>. She was tiny, graceful but clumsy, and often jealous, but I adored her. Because I did not have any siblings, she was my sister and my treasure.</p>

I was able to befriend people of different ethnicities that I had never seen before, and be a part of a school musical which I had <i>never</i> dreamed of. I still had my language barrier, but I advanced to an honors math class in middle school without knowing that I did. At the end of 8th grade, I received a medal for having the highest math average in class.<img src="images/graduation.jpg" alt="8th grade graduation" width="20%" height="20%" class="float_right"></p><br>
	<p class="first_line">I knew that I had to go to a good high school. I learned of the SHSAT and decided that a specialized high school was where I needed to go. Many of my friends took it as well, and a lot of them were accepted into <!-- Link to school website --><a href="http://www.bxscience.edu" target="_blank">Bronx Science</a>, including myself. <br>By this point, I had almost no trouble with English. Most of my friends and teachers did not even realize that I was a non-native speaker.<br>At Bronx Science, I joined the speech and debate team. I was a quarterfinalist at a tournament at University of Pennsylvania last year.</p>

	<p><span class="first_letter">F</span>ive and a half years have passed since I came to New York. I still need development in my writing, and there are many words that I still do not understand when I am reading a text in English or history class.<br>But I believe that, because I succeeded despite my language barrier and family struggles, I can overcome anything.<br>I want to go to a good college and make my father proud. I know he is always looking after me somewhere, encouraging me to continue studying as he had always taught me.<br>But I want my mother to be proud even more. Everyday she encourages me and makes sure I am on the right track. I want to succeed for her.<br>But that is not to say that I am trying to succeed merely for others. Most importantly, I want to succeed for myself. I have gone through some tough experiences, but that has not let me down. I want to achieve to my best ability so that I can be proud of myself.</p>
	<h3>My Future</h3>
	<p>I have no idea what I want to be in the future yet. But I still have time, and right now, I am constantly challenging myself to see what I am capable of doing.<br>However, I do have a few small dreams for the future. I want to travel around the world and see all the historical elements I have learned in the past few years. I also want a nice apartment in the city with enough space to put a grand piano. And a puppy.</p>
